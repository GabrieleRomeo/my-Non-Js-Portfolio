                      The initial requirements were: 'Build an app similar to

                      including some response fields for collecting information

                      As a naming convention for classes in HTML and CSS,
                      we used the Block, Element, Modifier (BEM) methodology
                      whereas for the layout we followed a Mobile-First
                      Responsive-Design approach based on a vertical rhythm
                      with a base font-size of 16px (100&#37;) and a line-height
                      of 1.5rem.
                      We used plain Javascript for the validation as well as
                      HTML5 Local Storage to memorize the information.
                      The application logic is written almost entirely in the

                      a user visits the page, the data are downloaded from the
                      Free Music Archive through a <em>XMLHttpRequest</em> and
                      then stored in IndexedDB.<p>

                      The Music Catalog project I developed makes use of
                      <em>IndexedDB</em> as well as the
                      <em>sessionStorage object</em> for holding
                      user preference about the view.

                    <p>
                      Long text descriptions are cut and the system shows a
                      <em>Show More</em> link so that the user can see the
                      remaining text.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      A user may switch between the <em>list</em> and <em>table</em>
                      view using the appropriate button.

                      I also added the search capability so that a user can
                      seek a particular text within Albums titles and descriptions.
